            Sometimes, the things I didn’t do are what I regret the most. One of my biggest regrets is not learning English when I was younger. I had time and tools, but I didn’t take it seriously. Now I understand how important English is for work, travel, and communication. I also regret not spending more time on music. I love it, but I didn’t practice or improve when I had the chance. Another regret is not trying to study at a good university. I was afraid to fail, and I didn’t ask for help or look for scholarships. These missed opportunities are in the past, but they still affect my present.

        <div class="highlight present">
            Right now, I want to change that. I am trying new study methods, like watching videos, using apps, and making a weekly study plan. I want to fill the gaps I left before and become more organized and motivated. I also try to stay consistent and not give up.
        </div>

        <div class="highlight future">
            In the future, I hope to use my new skills in a good job and grow professionally. I want to make better decisions and take smart opportunities. My regrets remind me of what I don’t want to repeat. I want to grow and turn my mistakes into something positive.
